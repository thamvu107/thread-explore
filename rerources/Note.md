- Using thread-safe APIs
    - If you need to use a Java library in a concurrent application, read its documentation first to know whether it's thread-safe or not. If it's thread-safe, you can use it in your application without any problem. If it's not, you have the following two options:
        - If a thread-safe alternative exists, you should use it
        - If a thread-safe alternative doesn't exist, you should add the necessary synchronization to avoid all possible problematic situations, especially data race conditions
    - Key Strategies for Using Thread-Safe APIs:
      - Check the Documentation:
        - Always read the documentation of the library or class you are using to determine if it is thread-safe. For instance, ArrayList is not thread-safe, whereas Vector is.
      - Use Thread-Safe Alternatives:
        - If a non-thread-safe class is unsuitable for concurrent use, find a thread-safe alternative. Java provides several thread-safe collections and utilities in the java.util.concurrent package.
      - Add Synchronization:
        - If a thread-safe alternative does not exist, you can add synchronization to ensure safe concurrent access. However, this can be more complex and less efficient than using built-in thread-safe classes.
        
- Threads: Java applications rely on OS-level threads, which are heavyweight entities managed by the operating system. Each thread consumes significant memory resources, limiting scalability and imposing overhead on the system.
