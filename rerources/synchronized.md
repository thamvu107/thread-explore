- Three Ways to Use Synchronized
  - Synchronized Instance Methods:
    - one thread can execute the method at a time for each instance of the class.
    - NOTE: if a class has **multiple instance methods** that are **synchronized**, only one thread can execute one of these methods on an instance of the class at the same time.
